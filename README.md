### Angular 2 Tour of Heroes Tutorial - built with gulp

Tour of Heroes: Angular2 tutorial gulped for practice 

This is a copy of the Angular2 Tour of Heroes code taken from here [https://angular.io/resources/live-examples/toh-6/ts/plnkr.html]

Note that the project is kept so that at all times code can be deployed with npm start, as for the tutorial itself.

> git clone etc .... checkout this code

> npm install - creates node_modules directory with your dependencies DO NOT CHECK IN ensure .gitignore is working

> gulp build - checks typescript is well formed and copies all files into dist directory, also index.html and required config for typescript (transpiliers - still learning here) and systemJS (module loading library)

> gulp serve - starts a tab in Chrome and loads the app out of the dist directoryu at localhost:3000/

enjoy! please test, learn and provide adjustments if needs be
